## 1. What is React?

React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes. React's main goal is to be fast, scalable, and simple.

## 2. Setting Up the Development Environment

To start using React, you need to set up your development environment. This involves installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager), and then using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) to bootstrap a new React project.

### Steps:

1. Install Node.js and npm from the official website.
2. Open your terminal and run the following command to install Create React App globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g create-react-app
   ```
